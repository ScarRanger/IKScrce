            <h2>Astronomical Instruments in India</h2>
            <p>
                Indian astronomers, with their profound understanding of celestial mechanics, developed a variety of sophisticated instruments for observing and measuring the positions and movements of celestial bodies. These instruments played a crucial role in their astronomical calculations and the development of their calendar systems.

                <h3>1. Gnomon (Shanku Yantra)</h3>
                <div class="instrument-details">
                    <div class="image-container">

                    </div>
                    <p>A simple shadow-casting instrument consisting of a vertical rod or pillar. By observing the length and direction of the shadow cast by the Gnomon throughout the day, astronomers could measure time, determine the Sun's altitude, and calculate the local latitude.</p>

            <div class="instrument">
                <h3>2. Astrolabe</h3>
                <div class="instrument-details">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="" alt="Astrolabe">
                    </div>
                    <p>The Astrolabe, adopted and further developed by Indian astronomers, was a versatile instrument used for determining the position of celestial objects such as stars and planets. It could also be used for timekeeping, surveying, and navigation.</p>

            <div class="instrument">
                <h3>3. Samrat Yantra</h3>
                <div class="instrument-details">
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="" alt="Samrat Yantra">
                    </div>
                    <p>The Samrat Yantra, meaning "supreme instrument," is a massive equinoctial sundial, most notably found at the Jantar Mantar observatories built by Maharaja Jai Singh II. Its large size and precise markings allowed for the measurement of time with remarkable accuracy, as well as the declination of celestial bodies.</p>

                        <img src="" alt="Nadivalaya Yantra">
                    </div>
                    <p>The Nadivalaya Yantra is an instrument designed to measure the altitude of celestial bodies as they cross the meridian (the imaginary line running from north to south through the zenith). Observations with this instrument helped determine the celestial coordinates of stars and planets.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The Kapala Yantra was a spherical instrument used for observing the positions and apparent motion of planets. Its design allowed astronomers to track the celestial longitude and latitude of planets over time.</p>
